# Madman

Game made for [Ludum Dare 48](https://ldjam.com/).

## Mechanics

You're a crazy scientist who doesn't like how loudy your city became recently, as the lockdown has been ended.
People flooded the street and shouting, because... well, just because they are allowed to.

In such a cacaphony you cannot concentrate on your project, so you decided to find and dust your old hypnotizer tool,
go through the city and hypnotize everyone you can.
        
Obviously, it's not legal to do, so soon the police will cache you.
Accomplish your goal and decrease the city's noise to 40 decibel before they get you.
